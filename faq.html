<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>Who can I get a Zaka loan?</h3>
<p>Zaka connects investors to investment ready entrepreneurs. Zaka therefore identifies, prepares for investment and profiles into Zaka.co.ke financially excluded entrepreneurs who can’t access growth capital and affordable sources of credit due to various barriers in the formal financial system. Zaka team and partners (incubators and accelerators) conduct a thorough due diligence followed by investment preparation program to build their capacity.

At Zaka, we are sector-agnostic therefore entrepreneurs from all sectors can borrow through Zaka platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>How does Zaka determine the interest rates on loans?</h3>
<p>Zaka does not dictate interest rates to entrepreneurs or investors, all Zaka does is provide an indicative rate based on the entrepreneurs risk profile. The investors is then at liberty to make an offer to the entrepreneur. The entrepreneurs can either a) accept, b) reject, or c) negotiate. This way a fair interest acceptable to both the lender and borrow is charged.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>Can a Zaka investor offer a loan at 0% interest?</h3>
<p>Yes, social investors and philanthropic lenders keen to support say, a women group can offer a loan at zero % interest. In this case, the investor only makes a 2.5% fee to support the operations of zaka platform and meet additional costs of including training, financial literacy classes and clients’ mobilization.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>Can I be both a lender (Investor) and a borrower (entrepreneur)?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can register into the Zaka platform as an investor and a borrower. You however cannot borrow and lend at the same time, you can either borrow or invest at any one given time.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>As an investor in Zaka, do I need to fund the entire loan?</h3>
<p>No, Zaka allows for syndicated loans using a crowdfunding approach. There are many individual lenders who come together to contribute towards a posted loan.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>Am I guaranteed that I get 100% repaid?</h3>
<p>Zaka conducts a thorough due diligence on all the entrepreneurs posted on the website. The spirit of Zaka is to overcome the barriers that have existed barring credible entrepreneurs from accessing growth capital, key among them being security/collateral – we therefore drive a trust-based approach. Zaka therefore does not guarantee repayment for any loans crowdfunded on the Zaka website.

Past borrowing history does not always guarantee future repayment, and Zaka investors should bare this in mind while making loans that could lead to losing some or all of the lender’s principal</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>Why should I pay Zaka registration fees and that too before getting the loan?</h3>
<p>Zaka has an in-house assesment team which conducts due diligence and carefully assess each borrower profile which involves cost, time and effort. The registration fees caters for these cost and also meets the maintenance cost for the portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>What does it cost an entrepreneur to access Zaka portal</h3>
<p>The entrepreneur pays a one-off registration fees of Kes 5,000.00 and on application and approval of loan, pays 4% for processing and payment gateway fees. The investor does n</p>
</div><div class="s-project-details">
How does Zaka attain sustainability?
Zaka is a for profit limited liability company. Zaka therefore takes a fee from the platform users. An entrepreneur pays 2.5% success fees on successful crowdfunding while the investor equally charged a 2.5% for administration, continuous investment monitoring and investment preparation.
<h3>Who are Zaka Partners?</h3>
<p>These are mainly organizations who share similar values with Zaka and work to provide incubation, acceleration and enterprise support services to targeted entrepreneurs. This way, over and above Zaka investment preparation program, Zaka is able to reach more entrepreneurs spread across a wide geography more effectively. These partners work in entrepreneur communities and vet borrowers, provide services and ensure “know-your-customer” policy is maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>What’s the difference between a Straight Zaka loan and a Zaka loan?</h3>
<p>Zaka loans are loans crowd sourced through Zaka website and offered by a network of zaka investors. Zaka Straight loans are made off Zaka International’s balance sheet don’t involve a Zaka investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>How does the money for the loan get to each borrower?</h3>
<p>Loan funds reach borrowers through the money transfer platform provided by Nouveta. This includes Mpesa, Airtel money, Equitel and Paypal.

For Zaka loans, once the loan is fully crowdfunded on Zaka, funds are transmitted to the borrower via the above referenced payment gateway.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>What is the due diligence process on Zaka loans?</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs profiled on Zaka Platform are identified and vetted by either a Zaka Partner (Accelerator or Incubator) or Zaka Investment preparation team. For the partners, Zaka conducts a due diligence on the Enterprise support provider, Accelerator and/or Incubators.</p>

Zaka Team conduct due diligence by following the following steps: <li>a) Conduct know-your-customer process,</li><li> b) Entrepreneur selection criteria – Entrepreneur of high integrity, with good, long-term growth prospects, </li><li>c) Client visit and interview entrepreneur,</li><li> d) Reference check and review, </li><li>e) Enter into 1
month investment preparation program, </li><li>f) Graduation and registration into Zaka Website. With this, Entrepreneurs can be connected to the Zaka network of investors.
What happens if a loan doesn’t get fully funded on the Zaka Platform?
Loans are posted into Zaka platform for a period of 30 days, after which they are put in the back for an additional 15 days. If the loans are not fully funded, then they are passed over to Zaka Straight loans for further review and possible top-up.

There are possible cases where entrepreneurs won’t receive their loan even after profiling the same on Zaka website. When this happens, the investors who will have committed funds will get the same reimbursed. These should be rare cases and Zaka will do absolute best to ensure such cases are completely minimized.
How do loan repayments get back to the Zaka investors?
Loans are repaid from the entrepreneurs to the Zaka Investors through the Zaka payment gateway supported by Nouveta. Entrepreneurs use Zaka Payment platform to remit repayments and Zaka directs repaid loans into the investors wallet account.
Once repaid, the investor can withdraw for different use, lend to another entrepreneur or donate to Zaka’s entrepreneurs support program.
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>What does it cost the Investor to access the Zaka portal?</h3>
<p>The investor does not pay anything on registration to access Zaka, it’s completely free. On making the investment, the investor meets the cost of the payment gateway and monitoring fee 4%.</p>
</div>
<div class="s-project-details">
<h3>What happens if an entrepreneur can’t repay the loan for one reason or another?</h3>
<p>Now this is a real possibility in credit. In the even that an entrepreneur fall behind in loan payment, then Zaka will schedule to meet the entrepreneur and understand the circumstances and make a decision that safe-guards the investors funds. The loan may be re-scheduled to allow the entrepreneur re-organize their cash-flows.</p>
<p>It is important to point out here that Zaka model is trust based and works to support the entrepreneur with Patient capital, so loan reschedule allows for this objective to be met. This is common practice in credit business.</p>


<p>We also want to point out that sometimes, even with these efforts to recover, there may be cases where the entrepreneur simply can’t repay and the loan become delinquent. When this happens, Zaka will notify all contributing investors by email and schedule a meeting with the defaulter on the way forward. Zaka, Entrepreneur and Investors will then come out with a win-win approach on the way forward.</p>
