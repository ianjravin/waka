              <p>Welcome to Zaka International, a Kenyan-based limited liability company (together with its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively, "zaka"). This Terms of Use ("Agreement") is a contract between you ("you") and Zaka and governs your access and use of the zaka.co.ke website and all other websites owned and operated by zaka international that have this Agreement posted (collectively, the "Website"), including, but not limited to, all transactions conducted on the Website and all zaka services provided in connection with the Website. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have read all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you participate in Zaka’s investing/lending, borrowing or related programs, services or activities (collectively, the "Program") or otherwise access or use the Website (in each such capacity, a "User"). If you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, please do not participate in the Program or access or use the Website.</p>
                <p>You’re legally agreeing to the terms on this page when you visit and use Zaka’s website. So you should read them. This column can help you navigate the major points in the terms.</p>

                <p>If you don’t agree with these terms, you shouldn’t use Zaka’s website.</p>
                <p>This Agreement supersedes any previous agreement to which you and Zaka may have been bound (provided that if you are a Borrower, Investor, Lender or Partner who has a separate written agreement with Zaka, the terms of that separate agreement will control with respect to any provision that conflicts with this Agreement). This Agreement may be modified by Zaka in its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications shall automatically become part of this Agreement and shall be effective once posted by zaka on the Website (as indicated by the posted update date). Your participation in the Program and use of the Website will be subject to any such modifications. You should review the Website and this Agreement from time to time for any modifications. If you do not agree with any such modifications, please immediately terminate your registered zaka account, if any, as outlined in Section 8 below, and please immediately stop participating in the Program and accessing and using the Website.</p>
                <p>The Terms of Use is the current agreement between you and Zaka. If you have any other contracts with zaka (for example if you are a zaka borrower or investor), those may override certain things in this Terms of Use.
                Zaka may make changes to this agreement at any time. When we do, you’ll know we’ve updated it by looking at the date at the top of the page.</p>
                <p>This Agreement is divided into the following sections:</p>

                <p>
                  <ul class="angles">
                    <h4><strong>1. Participation in the Zaka Platform</strong></h4>
                    <p>Zaka manages the Website, which connects you and other participants in the marketplace/platform (ie "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with borrowers and social enterprises in various countries in need of affordable capital (each, a "Borrower" and, collectively, "Borrowers"). In most instances, these SME Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lack of credit history, the use  of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a "start up" business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations</p>
                         <p>This section describes what Zaka does and does not do. Investment/lending on Zaka website is risky and you might not get repaid what you lend. You may participate in the Program as an investor by creating an online account on the Zaka website registered to your email address. All transactions between Investors (Lenders) and Entrepreneurs (Borrowers) must be conducted through a Zaka account – which means technically speaking, Zaka may be considered the “lender” on your behalf when you make Loans on the Website. The amount of funds you have available in your Zaka account that you have deposited and is freely available to be lent out is referred to as your "Zaka Credit." If you make a loan through the Zaka Website, you are in essence instructing Zaka to utilize your Zaka Credit to fund the specific Loan you have designated on the Website. All Zaka Credit in your Zaka account must be lent and repaid to your account before you can withdraw it.</p>
                         <p>You are required to register and create an account to transact on the Zaka platform. Money in your account (wallet) is called “Zaka credit” and it can be used to make loans on Zaka.co.ke. You can’t withdraw money from your account until it’s been lent out to a borrower and repaid to your account.
                         By participating in the Zaka Program or otherwise accessing or using the Zaka Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that <li>(a) Zaka makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you lend to a Borrower via the Website will be repaid in whole or in part,</li> <li>(b) loans and other similar transactions made via the Website are unsecured and bear a high risk of non-repayment and</li> <li>(c) given your financial situation and objectives, you will lend only those amounts on the Website that you can afford to risk.</li> Loans made via the Website are not cancellable or refundable by the User.
                         Zaka will hold amounts due and payable to Investors (Lenders) and Entrepreneurs (Borrowers separate from Zaka’s funds, in a deposit account established to hold funds for the benefit of Participants. Zaka will not use such amounts for Zaka’s general operating expenses; however, Zaka reserves the right to retain (a) interest on funds while such funds are held in a Participants Funds Account and (b) any foreign exchange gains collected in connection with Loan repayments, and to use such interest and gains in support of Zaka’s general operating expenses.
                       </p>
<h4><strong>1.1 Description of Products & Services</strong></h4>
                    <p>Zaka is an online platform (marketplace) where entrepreneurs (borrowers) and investors (Lenders) interact directly on deals that will favour business growth and mutually benefit both parties – ie entrepreneurs and investors. The investors and entrepreneurs have the power to determine favourable terms and overcome the barriers to capital access.</p>
<h4><strong>1.2 Loan disbursment</strong></h4>

                    <p>Zaka Loans are made directly to Entrepreneurs (Borrowers) by a network of investors (Lenders) registered in Zaka platform. Entrepreneur loan requests are submitted by Borrowers and approved by Zaka before they are posted to the Website. Funds loaned by you, the Lender, will be transferred directly to the account of the Borrower you have chosen to support. Zaka serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a Participants Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Zaka’s operations) to the Borrower. Zaka expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen Borrowers or monitor Borrowers’ operations. Zaka and Directors shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers, and you shall hold Zaka and the Directors harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screening and selection of Borrowers.</p>
<h4><strong>1.3 Loan collection and repayment</strong></h4>

                    <p>Zaka Loans are repaid directly by Borrowers to Lenders. Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable Loan or as a bullet repayment of principle and interest. If, for any reason, Zaka, for any reason, is unable to collect Loan repayments directly from an entrepreneur (Borrower), repayment of your Loan amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Zaka bears no direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal plus interest and that Zaka is only obligated to repay only such Loan principal plus interest to the extent actually received by Zaka from an entrepreneur (Borrower). None of Zaka or its directors will have any obligation to pay penalties or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you or any other Lender in connection with any Loan you make on Zaka Platform.</p>
                    <h4><strong>1.4       Principal plus Interest Loss Cases.</strong></h4>
<p>Zaka will do it’s absolute best to collect principal plus interest on loans made on the Zaka Platform. A loan will be deemed in default if Zaka determines that collection of funds for such Loan is doubtful. You understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your Loan(s) and/or, in Zaka’s sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your Loan(s) in order to increase the chances that your Loan(s) will be repaid in whole or in part.
In addition to loan defaults, you may lose money because of changing currency exchange rates. Zaka loans are made in Kenya Shillings, but Investors may make loans in their country currency eh Euros, US dollars. This exposes the investor to exchange loss risk. If for any reason less than 100% of your Loan is repaid, you agree that neither Zaka nor its directors shall have any liability therefore, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Zaka, for any loss you may incur. You should consult with your accountant and/or tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of such a loss.</p>
<h4><strong>1.5       Tax Deductibility.</strong></h4>
<p>You acknowledge that making a Loan on the Zaka Website does not constitute a charitable donation, and therefore you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction for any funds lent to a Borrower through the Website. You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Loan you make through the Zaka Website. Zaka has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Loan you might make. This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax advisors and legal advisors.</p>
<h4><strong>1.6       Loan Records.</strong></h4>
<p>Records of each Loan you make are kept by Zaka and, if you have a registered account with Zaka and upon your written request, will be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the Loan.</p>
<h4><strong>1.7       Zaka Account Inactivity/Dormancy;</strong></h4>
<p>In the event a Zaka user (investor or entrepreneur) fails to operate their account for a period greater than 24 months, the said user will be deemed dormant. You required to instruct Zaka how you would like the funds in your Zaka Credit to be treated/applied:
Automatically donate remaining funds in your account to Zaka’s general operating expenses to further Zaka’s philanthropic mission
Return the remaining funds in your account to you via Zaka’s standard account withdrawal process.</p>
<p>In such cases of User inactivity, Zaka may choose to automatically terminate the inactive User account without further reference to yourself.
During registration on the Zaka Website you will be prompted to instruct Zaka on treatment of the remaining balance in case of dormancy</p>
<h4><strong>2. Additional Zaka Website Features</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>2.1      Auto-lending.</strong></h4>
<p>Zaka platform allows investors to automatically re-lend their funds on full repayment of previous loan. In this case Zaka gives lenders the option to have their Kiva credit automatically lent and re-lent according to criteria they set in advance. Zaka isn’t liable for any money you lose on loans made using this feature, and auto loans cannot be canceled.
You agree and understand that all Resources are provided on an “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” basis, without warranties or representations of any kind, either express or implied. Your use of the Resources is at your sole risk, and Zaka expressly disclaims all liability arising from or relating to the Resources. While Zaka strives to provide useful and accurate information, Zaka does not warrant that the information offered in the Resources is free of errors or opinion biases. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that may be deemed offensive or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Zaka with respect to the Resources.</p>
